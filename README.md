## Getting started

1. Clone the repository to your device. 

2. Install dependencies using: 

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   (You may need to install Expo, Node, etc.) 

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

4. Viewing the app:
* You can scan the QR code with your mobile device (iOS or Android) to view the mobile version of the app on your device. (NOTE: you must have the Expo Go application downloaded on your mobile device). 
* You also have the option to use a virtual emulator to view the mobile versions of the application through your computer screen.
* If all else fails, Press 'w' on your keyboard to launch the web version of the app on your computer in a new window (this is not exactly what the mobile app will look like, but you will get an idea of the UI).
